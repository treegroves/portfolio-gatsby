# Web Dev Portfolio

The purpose of this repo is to house my web development portfolio. It also acts as a learning environment for me to practice Gatsby.

Some of the pages link to my previous website, which I used to learn HTML & CSS.

## Going forward

As my knowledge of Gatsby develops, I intend to migrate and update my blog and incorporate it into the repo.

## Questions
