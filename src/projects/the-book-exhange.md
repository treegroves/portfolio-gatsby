# The Book Exchange:
The Book Exchange is a collaborative effort to produce as a capstone project for the Dev Academy Aotearoa Bootcamp.
it is an online marketplace for users to exchange books they’ve already read for books they haven’t.

**Reflections:**  
A key reflection that I would like to share is that team culture is integral to a successful project. During the creation of our team agreement, I championed having clear expectations of roles to streamline communication. This was taken up by the team and avoided any major conflict and I felt a very streamlined process. Having clear initial expectations shifted our team dynamic in a more trusting and open direction, and ultimately, we didn’t have to deal with conflict and produced a product we were happy with, in relation to our minimum viable product (MVP).
