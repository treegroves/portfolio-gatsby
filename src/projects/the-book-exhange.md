**My Role:**

***A highlight of this project was the UX/UI design I did to make this project look really good and function well for the user. I enjoyed standardizing the Styling over the different aspects of the project. There were a few UI challenges in particular that I enjoyed solving, namely the user profile and user book listing page. Due to the tight schedule for completion, we were running close to the deadline, and I didn’t have a lot of time to dedicate to styling, so completed it in less than half a day. If I were to do it over again, I would allocate more time to this.***

As part of this project, I filled the Agile role of Git Keeper. I ensured that my peers worked in feature branches and did pull requests that lined up with the completion of tickets. I reviewed pull requests, ensured that they contained clean code, and made sure the merge would not cause conflicts.

I also created the database as well as the Migrations and Seed data. From this, I learned the importance of using an entity relationship diagram (ERD). As we progressed in the project, we needed to add one or two extra columns, which was easily done; the key takeaway from that is to invest a bit more time in DB planning.

I also coded my way through a complete Server Client side pathway. What I’m proud of here, is that I successfully created the "plumbing" to carry data from the database to the Home Component (Database/API/React/Redux) and understood each step. There were times I got stuck, but patience and solid problem-solving got me through. On top of this, I completed nearly full test coverage. I still have some learning to do around Component testing, but my knowledge of unit testing was really solidified by this process.


**Reflections:**  
A key reflection that I would like to share is that team culture is integral to a successful project. During the creation of our team agreement, I championed having clear expectations of roles to streamline communication. This was taken up by the team and avoided any major conflict and I felt a very streamlined process. Having clear initial expectations shifted our team dynamic in a more trusting and open direction, and ultimately, we didn’t have to deal with conflict and produced a product we were happy with, in relation to our minimum viable product (MVP).
