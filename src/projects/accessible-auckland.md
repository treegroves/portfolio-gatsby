# Accessible Auckland
Accessible Auckland is a solo project I am working on, influenced by Accessible-Japan, and spurred on by my desire as a access citizen to make going out an easier process for people with access needs. The goal to is to create a webapp that presents accessibility information about locations around Auckland, in a usable way. 


#### Minimum Viable Product(MVP):
Currently I am focussing on reaching MVP, which involves a database with regions and locations tables, as well as search functionality.
