Accessible Auckland is a solo project I am working on, influenced by Accessible-Japan, and spurred on by my desire as an access citizen to make going out an easier process for people with access needs. The goal is to create a web app that presents accessibility information about locations around Auckland, in a usable way. 

Currently, I am focussing on reaching MVP, which involves a database with region and location tables, as well as a search function.
