JavaScript Carnival was a series of Kata-like projects I created as part of the Dev Academy Aotearoa's Foundations course.
We created several programs, with various carnival themes (Think Unicorns, Clowns, Wack-a-mole). It was a bit of fun, but it also shows how I have learned and applied JavaScript.
